# RotocasterFirmware
This is the accompanying code for the rotocasting machine, made in 2025 for the KU Leuven soft robotics research team.

Here, you can find the main code (arduino .ino files) as well as other people's libraries used for this project.

I changed some of these libraries to add or change functionalities, so be sure to add the ones you find here to your Arduino -> libraries directory

You should also have the Earle Philhowers Arduino Pico core installed.
