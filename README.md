# RotocasterKUL
This is the accompanying documentation for the rotocasting machine, made in 2025 for the KU Leuven soft robotics research team.


## Software
Here, you can find the main code under RotocasterMainFirmware (arduino .ino files) as well as other people's libraries used for this project.

I changed some of these libraries to add or change functionalities, so be sure to add the ones you find here to your Arduino -> libraries directory

You should also have the Earle Philhowers Arduino Pico core installed.

Some useful tutorials for uploading:

## Electrical Hardware
The KiCAD design files can be found here. If there is something that needs to change, you can find the current version of the project here.

## Mechanical Hardware
A .step file is uploaded here to get a better grasp of what might be going on under the covers. This is not a build guide, rather part of the documentation.
